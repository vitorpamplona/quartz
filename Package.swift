// Swift Package Manager entry point for Quartz. The library ships as QuartzKit.xcframework,
// attached to each GitHub release. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) runs
// tools/release/prepare-release.sh, which rewrites the url and checksum below, so the copy of
// this file at tag v<version> names that release's zip. Don't edit them by hand.
